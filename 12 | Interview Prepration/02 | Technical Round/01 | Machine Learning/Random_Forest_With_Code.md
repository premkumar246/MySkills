46. **Implement a Random Forest classifier using Python's `sklearn` library.**
   - Import the necessary modules.
   - Load a dataset (e.g., Iris or Titanic dataset).
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
   - Train the Random Forest classifier.
   - Evaluate its accuracy.
```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# Load dataset
data = load_iris()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest model
rf_clf = RandomForestClassifier(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions and accuracy
y_pred = rf_clf.predict(X_test)
accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

   - Load a dataset (e.g., Boston housing dataset).
   - Train a Random Forest regressor.

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestRegressor
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_boston
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error

# Load dataset
data = load_boston()
X, y = data.data, data.target

# Train-test split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.3, random_state=42)

# Train Random Forest model
rf_reg = RandomForestRegressor(n_estimators=100, random_state=42)
rf_reg.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Predictions and MSE

mse = mean_squared_error(y_test, y_pred)
print("Mean Squared Error:", mse)
```

48. **Perform feature importance extraction from a Random Forest model.**
   - Train a Random Forest classifier or regressor.
   - Extract and plot the importance of each feature.
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np

# Train Random Forest model (use the previous classifier code)
rf_clf.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Extract feature importance
importance = rf_clf.feature_importances_

# Plot feature importance
plt.barh(range(len(importance)), importance)
plt.yticks(np.arange(len(importance)), data.feature_names)
plt.xlabel("Feature Importance")
plt.ylabel("Feature")
plt.show()
```

49. **Tune Random Forest hyperparameters using GridSearchCV.**
   - Implement a GridSearch to optimize Random Forest hyperparameters such as `n_estimators`, `max_depth`, and `min_samples_split`.
```python
from sklearn.model_selection import GridSearchCV

# Define the hyperparameter grid
param_grid = {
    'n_estimators': [50, 100, 200],
    'max_depth': [None, 10, 20, 30],
    'min_samples_split': [2, 5, 10]
}

# Grid Search with Cross-Validation
grid_search = GridSearchCV(estimator=rf_clf, param_grid=param_grid, cv=5, scoring='accuracy')
grid_search.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Best parameters
print("Best parameters:", grid_search.best_params_)
```

50. **Visualize a single decision tree from a Random Forest model.**
   - Extract one of the trees from the trained Random Forest and visualize it using `graphviz` or `plot_tree` from `sklearn`.
```python
from sklearn.tree import plot_tree

# Extract a single tree from the Random Forest
single_tree = rf_clf.estimators_[0]

# Plot the tree
plt.figure(figsize=(15,10))
plot_tree(single_tree, filled=True, feature_names=data.feature_names, class_names=data.target_names, rounded=True)
plt.show()
```
