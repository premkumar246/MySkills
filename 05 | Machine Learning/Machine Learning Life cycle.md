#### **2. Data Collection**
- **Source Identification**: Determine all possible data sources (internal databases, external APIs).
- **Data Gathering**: Extract and load data into a working environment.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Generate summary statistics and visualize data to understand distributions, outliers, and relationships.

#### **3. Data Preprocessing**
- **Data Cleaning**: 
  - **Imputation**: Use statistical methods (mean, median) or model-based methods (KNN imputation) to handle missing values.
  - **Outlier Treatment**: Identify and handle outliers using methods like z-score, IQR.
- **Data Transformation**:
  - **Normalization**: Scale features to a range, typically [0,1].

  - **Feature Importance**: Use models (e.g., tree-based) to assess the importance of features.

#### **4. Data Splitting**
- **Stratified Sampling**: Ensure that the distribution of target variables is similar in training and testing sets.
- **Time Series Consideration**: Use techniques like rolling window validation for time series data.

#### **5. Model Selection**

  - **Leave-One-Out**: Use each individual sample as a validation set.
- **Training**: Fit the model to the training data.

#### **7. Model Evaluation**

1. **Problem Definition**: Predict house prices based on features like size, location, and age.
2. **Data Collection**: Gather historical housing data from real estate websites and government databases.
3. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean data, handle missing values, normalize features, and encode categorical variables (e.g., location as a one-hot encoded feature).
4. **Data Splitting**: Split data into training (70%), validation (15%), and test sets (15%).
5. **Model Selection**: Choose models like linear regression, decision trees, and gradient boosting.
