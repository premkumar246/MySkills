# Crew AI 

Crew AI refers to a framework or concept for creating AI systems that work together as a coordinated team, similar to how a human crew might collaborate on complex tasks. It involves:

1. Multiple AI agents: Each with specialized roles or capabilities.

2. Coordination: Mechanisms for the AI agents to communicate and work together effectively.

3. Task division: Splitting complex problems into subtasks that can be handled by different AI "crew members."

4. Adaptive problem-solving: The ability to adjust strategies and roles as needed to complete objectives.

This approach aims to leverage the strengths of different AI models or systems to tackle more complex tasks than a single AI could handle alone. It's an area of ongoing research and development in the field of artificial intelligence.
